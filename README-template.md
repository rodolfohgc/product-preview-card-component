## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Probably it was the first time I used the <picture> element. It took a while to customize the desktop version, as the image wasn't responsive to the layout, but the adjustments weren't too difficult.

### Continued development

I wanna try and use the <picture> more often, as it's a really helpful resource when working with images.

### Useful resources

- [The picture element | web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/design/picture-element) - This will help to tackle the two-different-images-with-two-different-orientations problem.
